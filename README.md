# FastGAPP v2.0
A Matlab GUI supports Earth Scientists

Geochemical studies of igneous rocks are fundamental to classify rock types in terms of main-, minor , and trace element whole-rock chemistry. Together with petrographic thin section observations Earth scientists classify igneous rocks and draw interpretations about:

•	The petrogenesis and evolution of igneous rocks.

•	The thermal and barometric conditions in which a primary magma have formed.

•	The magmatic processes that might be involved in the evolution of igneous rocks.

•	The geotectonic environment in which igneous rocks might have formed.

Specific programs for the evaluation of geochemical data of igneous rocks are rare and difficult to use. Additionally, changing the setup of the created plots and comparison with publicized data are extremely time-intensive, and therefore, expensive and inefficient. FastGAPP v2.0 (Fast Geoscientific Analysis Plotting Program), a user-friendly MATLAB-based program automatically reads geochemical datasets from Excel spreadsheets or mat-files, normalizes the data volatile-free, and allows to plot up to 9 datasets in a quantity of geochemical classification, magma-series and geotectonic discrimination diagrams, which are based on approximately one century of petrological and geochemical research. Several function like the MULTIPLotter and the PLOT-O-MAT integrated in FastGAPP easily allow users to create rare-earth element, multi-element plots and variation diagrams.
FastGAPP v2.0 can also support Earth scientists from other fields. Other integrated programs allow to plot petrographic data from igneous rocks (PetroPlot v2.0), to evaluate compositional and grain size data from sedimentary rocks (SediPlot v1.0), and grain size analyses from (SoilPlot v1.0). Moreover, the development tools included in FastGAPP v2.0 allow scientists without programming skills to enhance the database of normalization values and plots for all programs, but also develop new programs. Therefore, the new version of FastGAPP yields an interesting, very user-friendly base with many applications in research and teaching not only for whole-rock geochemistry and petrography, but also for other fields of Earth Sciences.
